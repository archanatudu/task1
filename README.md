# My HTML/CSS Project

This project contains an HTML file and a CSS file for styling.

## How to View

To view the HTML file, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `a.html` file in a web browser.

## Code Snippets

Here's what the `a.html` file looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

And here's the content of the `style.css` file:

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

## Expected Output

When you open `a.html` in a web browser, you should see a blue "Hello, World!" heading.
